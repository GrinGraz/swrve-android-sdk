        severity="Warning"
        message="Lint found one or more custom checks using its older Java API; these checks are still run in compatibility mode, but this causes duplicated parsing, and in the next version lint will no longer include this legacy mode. Make sure the following lint detectors are upgraded to the new API: timber.lint.WrongTimberUsageDetector"

        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance, degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.">
